This is a college project, from the Algorithms and Data Structures 1 class. It reads a .txt file and creates a generic tree. Each Node of the tree contains the name and the amount of land of a barbarian warrior. Each file represents a parchment from a barbarian family. The goal of the project is to: 
    1-Read the parchment
    2-Create the generic tree
    3-Divide the amount of land of every father to it's children
    4-Show the warrior of the last generation with the most amount of land

There is a folder containing severel files, each one with a different tree to be generated. All files must follow the same structure, in order of the program to work.
